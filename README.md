Dynamic Single Page Application (SPA) Without a Framework Resource &amp; Guide

**STEPS TO PREVIEW IN BROWSER**
- cd (to directory this file is located in)
- Ensure you have this installed: https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
- In Terminal: `http-server -c-1`
- Open browser and go to http://localhost:8080/ if this file is index.html
- IF the main `.html` file isn't named index.html, just add the endpoint of the file (ex: http://localhost:8080/template.html)
- ALSO, you can `http-server -c-1 -p 8010` (will change port to 8010 if there's a conflict for some reason)
- ALSO, you may need to `sudo kill -9 PID` (If port has conflict (`top`: to find out PID)
